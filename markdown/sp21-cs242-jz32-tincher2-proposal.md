Jiaming Zhang (jz32) | Moderator: Bailey Tincher (tincher2)

This is a mobile app about a project for CS242

## "Popular Games"
### Project Purpose
I am thinking of building a mobile app that can help people, both customers and developers to see the mainstream of current video games industry.

### Project Motivation
I am very interested in both video game industry and software developing. I always talked to my game design mentor on whatâ€™s the industry trending now. 

## Technical Specification
- Platform: Cross-platform app (React Native)
- Programming Languages: JavaScript /Python for Flask backend and scraping
- Stylistic Conventions: Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide/PEP 8 guide
- SDK: Facebook SDK for React Native
- Databse: MongoDB
- Server: AWS to deploy my REST API
- IDE: Visual Studio Code
- Tools/Interfaces: Mobile devices
- Target Audience: Game developer/audience interested in game industry

## Functional Specification
### Features
- Displaying IGN's recent high score games' information(
  Including title, genre, developer studio, development scale, etc
)
- Displaying recent the most favorable game genre/scale based on the information above.
- Displaying the most favorable game genre/other information of all the time.(or set a filter on time since)
- Displaying review article of game from IGN

### Scope of the project
- There is no intension to build account system for the project, meaning not storaging preference setting and browsing data.
- I hope I can add account and forum/post system in the future to enable users to communicate and comment.
- Scope is to realize the features and display them in mobile app.

## Brief Timeline
- Week 1: Build a scraper to scrape IGN to gather game's information and review article information.
- Week 2: Build a RESTful API to manipulate data in week 1
- Week 3: Build a mobile app with recent top game information and trending/review article for those game along with filter.
- Week 4: Build top game information and review of all time.
